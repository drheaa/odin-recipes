# Odin Recipes

This is my first HTML project as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. Starting this course was a big step for me toward learning web development from the ground up, and this project marks the first time I built a complete multi-page website using just HTML.

## About the Project

The website is a simple collection of my favorite recipes. It includes:
- A homepage with links to each recipe
- Three individual recipe pages with headings, paragraphs, images, and lists

I didn’t use any CSS or JavaScript yet — just pure HTML. It was a great way to understand how the structure of a webpage works before adding any styling or behavior.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to:
- Structure an HTML document properly
- Use headings, paragraphs, and lists to organize content
- Add images using the `<img>` tag
- Link between pages using relative paths with the `<a>` tag
- Set up a folder and file structure for a small website

## Personal Reflection

Doing this project helped me see how far I’ve already come since starting The Odin Project. At first, HTML felt like just another markup language, but building something on my own made it feel real. It’s exciting to see a webpage come together from scratch — especially knowing it's the foundation for everything else I’ll build later.

This small project gave me a lot of confidence to keep going. Onward to CSS!
